I'm a Data Engineer with 1+ year of direct experience in the field and versed in building ETLs, pipelines, and data infrastructure using the Google Cloud suite. I also had 4+ years of experience as a researcher, having held several research and data analyst positions where I worked with statistics, econometrics, and machine learning. My technical skills also include proficiency in Python (5+ years) and SQL (2+ years), in addition to having practical knowledge in other technologies, such as Pyspark, Prefect, Bash, PostgreSQL, and Docker. I'm also a highly motivated professional, with strong organizational and multi-tasking skills, who always aim to add value to the business and the teams I work with.
